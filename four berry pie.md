Ingredients
-----------

* 1 cup fresh strawberries, halved
* 1 cup raspberries
* 1 cup blackberries
* 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
* 3/4 cup cinammon sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1 9" double pie crust

Recipe
------

1. In a large mixing bowl, stir together cinammon sugar and cornstarch. Set
   aside some of the mixture for sprinkling on the pastry. Add strawberries,
   raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries (don't be afraid to make those cups
   heaping); gently toss until berries are coated. When using frozen fruit allow
   fruit mixture to stand for 15 to 30 minutes, or until fruit is partially
   thawed.
2. Line a 9 inch pie plate with half of the pastry and sprinkle it with
   cinammon sugar. Stir berry mixture, and transfer to the crust lined pie plate.
   Top with second crust, sprinkle with ciammon sugar and seal and crimp the edge.
   To prevent overbrowning, cover the edge of the pie with foil.
3. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 minutes when using fresh fruit,
   50 minutes for frozen fruit. Remove foil. Bake for an additional 20 to 30
   minutes, or until the top is golden. Cool on a wire rack.
