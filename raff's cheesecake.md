This is my old roommate's mom's cheesecake recipe, and it's one of the best
I've ever had!

Ingredients
-----------

##Crust

* 1/4 c butter
* 1/4 c sugar
* 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs (about 18 or 1 package)

##Filling

* 12 oz cream cheese (room temperature)
* 3/4 c sugar
* 3 eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla

##Topping

* 1 c sour cream
* 1/4 c sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla

Directions
----------

Melt butter and combine with other crust ingredients. Press into the bottom and sides
of a 9" glass(?) pie pan. Bake at 300 F for 10 minutes.

Beat together cream cheese and sugar. Add eggs one at a time. Add vanilla. Pour
into baked crust. Bake at 300 F for 40 minutes or until center is not wet. Let
cool 10 minutes.

Combine sour cream, sugar, and vanilla. Spread evenly over cooled pie. Return
to oven for 5 minutes. Chill at least 5 hours before serving.
