These are recipes that I have collected. Most of them start as recipes from
various online sites. I then incorporate suggestions from user comments, make
the recipe, and further enhance it based on my experience.

Thoughts
========

* I generally don't like variations. I try to figure out what my ideal variant
  is and just record that one
* I dislike vague or inconsistent recipes. I like finding concrete methods or
  tests for ensuring a good result
* I generally suck at cooking, so please add issues if you notice any

TODO
====

* A lot of recipes are in DOS format (boo) since I started this on Windows using Dropbox
* Should use markdown for recipes to allow for nice online formatting
* Add more TODOs to imperfect recipes
* Maybe add recipe category subdirectories
* Add markdown recipe templates
