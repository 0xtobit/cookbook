I learned this recipe from a bartender in the Bethlehem, PA Starters.

Ingredients
	*1/2 Lime (or equivalent amount of lime juice)
	*10-12 Mint Leaves
	*Sugar (optional, especially when using Sprite)
	*White Rum
	*Sprite (or soda water if you're not a sugar junky)
	*Ice
	
1. Muddle the lime, mint, and sugar together. Only bruise - don't shred - the mint.

2. Add a few ice cubes (the more lightweight the drinker, the more ice)

3. Fill 1/4 of the cup with rum, the rest with Sprite. Stir.
